# Progressivestack

## A web-app built in Ruby on Rails to measure your oppression and check your privilege

### What we do

* Yes this app is a parody (I think)

* All algorithms/algorithmic descriptions will be publicly available

* Please feel free to create an issue if you think my privilege algorithm is wrong!

### TECHNICAL INFO

Tools we use:

* Ruby on Rails 4.2.5.1

* Ruby 2.3.0

* Postgres 9.4.5

* Bootstrap3

### Inspiration

A lot of people talk about privilege and systemic oppression in the western world -

So wouldnâ€™t it be a great idea to actually be able to measure it?

That is the purpose of progressivestack - we take the brilliant logic used [here:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCwhlZtHhWs)

 - and break the system down to it's constituent parts
